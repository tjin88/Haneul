# Welcome to Hanuel, the Manga and Light Novel Tracking Platform
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ In honour of Wordle #1,087 (June 10, 2024), Haneul is officially doing it's pre-release! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction
This project was born out of personal necessity. It's designed to address the challenges manga and light novel readers face - keeping track of the latest chapters and managing personal collections. Traditional methods like bookmarking and relying on aggregator sites often lead to frustrations - for me, this was that translators & publishers get less user traffic, and thus drop amazing series. Haneul aims to provide an ethical and efficient solution.

## Project Overview
Haneul is a centralized place where you can easily access, manage, and track your manga and light novel collections. The goal is to offer a reliable service, and I hope it becomes a valuable tool in your reading journey.

## Features
* **Centralized Collection:** Manage and track your manga and light novel collections effortlessly.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a straightforward reading management experience.
* **Chrome/Firefox/Edge Extension:** (Currently waiting to deploy) 

## Getting Started
Join me in eliminating aggregator websites from the equation. Please stay tuned for more updates and detailed instructions on how to get started.
